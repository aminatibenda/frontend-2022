# BMW Angular Test 2022

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.4.

## Functionality

We have included screenshots of the design. 
We would like to see the list of vehicles displayed on the home page.
Once the user selects the X Models - all X models need to be displayed ref: screenshot-2.
Once an X model is selected, and the "Find my BMW" button is clicked - console log the selected vehicle.
Reference screenshots: angularTest2022/desktop_1.png, angularTest2022/desktop_2.png, mobile_1.jpg, mobile_2.jpg & mobile_nav.jpg

## Important
We also want the UI to be responsive.
Bootstrap is allowed. 
You can add your own icons.
Create your own json Object for the list of vehicles.
You can create your own components.
You don't need to commit the /dist folder, we will rebuild from our side.
You can use the notes.txt if there is anything you want us to know.

## Submitting your code
Create your own Branch.
Create a pull request from your branch.
We do not want your node modules.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
